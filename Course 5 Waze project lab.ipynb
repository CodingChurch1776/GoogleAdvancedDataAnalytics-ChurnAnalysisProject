    "Now that you've built your regression model, the next step is to share your findings with the Waze leadership team. Consider the following questions as you prepare to write your executive summary. Think about key points you may want to share with the team, and what information is most relevant to the user churn project.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. What variable most influenced the model's prediction? How? Was this surprising?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Were there any variables that you expected to be stronger predictors than they were?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why might a variable you thought to be important not be important in the model?\n",

    "4. I would not recommend using this model as its insights show that there is more improvement to be done to capture more users who are churning.\n",
    "5. I would improve the recall ability to match the precision level.\n",
